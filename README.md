# Chatbotwithfeedback
based on chatterbot library
This project was done to provide those who utilize the code with
at least the ghost of the experience of what it was like to talk with Admiral Rickover.
I built it with a check of the response so that the corpus could be organically updated, if 
one wanted, from additional published interviews or books about the Admiral.  The text to speech
version of the bot is still a work in progress.  I do not have enough voice time of the Admiral
to truly generate a Mary TTS implementation.
