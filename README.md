# Chatbotwithfeedback
Based on chatterbot library (https://github.com/gunthercox/ChatterBot )
This project was initially done to provide those who utilize the code with
at least the ghost of the experience of what it was like to talk with Admiral Rickover.
I built it with a check of the response so that the corpus could be organically updated, if 
one wanted, from additional published interviews or books about the Admiral.  The text to speech
version of the bot is still a work in progress.  I do not have enough voice time of the Admiral
to truly generate a proper Mary project TTS implementation ( https://github.com/marytts/marytts )

A newer version utilizes the native Windows 7 and later voice library (sounds like Dr. Hawking) to respond audibly through the computer speakers as well as textually.  Also, you can provide your own corpus to add to those produced for the chatbot libraries.  For example:  utilize the talking portions of Dr. Seuss books or scripts from your favorite TV show ( Big Bang Theory example:  https://bigbangtrans.wordpress.com/)
